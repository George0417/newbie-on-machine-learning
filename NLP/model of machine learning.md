# model of machine learning

### 1.Regression Algorithms
>Regression algorithm is a kind of algorithm that obtains the best combination of input features
 by minimizing the difference between the predicted value and the actual result value.
 
+ Ordinary Least Squares Regression (OLSR)
+ Linear Regression
+ Logistic Regression
+ Stepwise Regression
+ Locally Estimated Scatterplot Smoothing (LOESS)
+ Multivariate Adaptive Regression Splines (MARS

### 2.Instance-based Algorithms
>Generally, the similarity criterion is used to compare the similarity
between the predicted sample and the original sample, and then predict the results 

+ k-Nearest Neighbour (kNN)
+ Learning Vector Quantization (LVQ)
+ Self-Organizing Map (SOM)
+ Locally Weighted Learning (LWL)

### 3.Decision Tree Algorithms
>Based on the characteristics of raw data, a tree containing many decision paths is constructed.

+ Classification and Regression Tree (CART)
+ Iterative Dichotomiser 3 (ID3)
+ C4.5 and C5.0 (different versions of a powerful approach)
+ Chi-squared Automatic Interaction Detection (CHAID)
+ M5
+ Conditional Decision Trees

### 4.Bayesian Algorithms
>In problems like classification or regression , an algorithm based on Bayesian principle is implicitly used.

+ Naive Bayes
+ Gaussian Naive Bayes
+ Multinomial Naive Bayes
+ Averaged One-Dependence Estimators (AODE)
+ Bayesian Belief Network (BBN)
+ Bayesian Network (BN)

### 5.Clustering Algorithms
>the clustering algorithm  gather input samples into "data clusters" 
around some centers to discover some rules of data distribution structure.

+ k-Means
+ Hierarchical Clustering
+ Expectation Maximisation (EM)


### 6.Association Rule Learning Algorithms(recommendation model)
>It tries to extract rules that best explain the observed association between training samples, 
and acquire knowledge of dependencies or associations between an event and other events.

+ Apriori algorithm
+ Eclat algorithm

### 7.Artificial Neural Network Algorithms

+ Perceptron
+ Back-Propagation
+ Radial Basis Function Network (RBFN)


### 8.Deep Learning Algorithms
+ Deep Boltzmann Machine (DBM)
+ Deep Belief Networks (DBN)
+ Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)
+ Stacked Auto-Encoders


### 9.Dimensionality Reduction Algorithms
>Dimensional algorithms are trying to summarize and describe
most of the original information with less information (lower dimensional information).

+ Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
+ Principal Component Regression (PCR)
+ Partial Least Squares Regression (PLSR)
+ Sammon Mapping
+ Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
+ Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA)
+ Mixture Discriminant Analysis (MDA)
+ Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA)
+ Flexible Discriminant Analysis (FDA)

### 10.Ensemble Algorithms
>It usually combines several simple weak machine learning algorithms to make more reliable decisions.

+ Random Forest
+ Boosting
+ Bootstrapped Aggregation (Bagging)
+ AdaBoost
+ Stacked Generalization (blending)
+ Gradient Boosting Machines (GBM)
+ Gradient Boosted Regression Trees (GBRT)
